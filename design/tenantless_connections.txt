ISSUE:
- we have clients that ignore the delay parameter that is part of the reconnect message

- allow them to connect and stay connected
  - remove them from the database
  - or just ignore them

- how do I know when to stop processing the tenantless connections?
- how do I know when to process the tenantless connections?


LOGIC FLOW:

- online message processor
    - when receiving a online status message
      - if its tenantless 
        - record in the database
          - set org_id, account to ""
          - set tenantless_timestamp to current time
          - set tenantless_retry_timestamp to current time + offset (2h??)

- offline message processor
    - when receiving an offline status message
      - remove connection from database


- stale processor
  - when unable to lookup tenant
    - record in the database
      - set org_id, account to ""
      - set tenantless_timestamp to current time
      - set tenantless_retry_timestamp to current time + offset (2h??)


- tenantless processor
    - lookup a chunk of connections / hosts that need their tenantless timestamp updated
      - look for connections that have account / org-id set to ""
      - return list of account, client_id, CF
        - order by oldest
      - if the db is down...fail

    - for each host
      - retreive identity using cert / account lookup
        - if we tried too many times
          - 
        - if tenant lookup succeeds
          - update record in database to record account/org-id
        - if account lookup fails
          - increment count of failures
          - set tenantless_retry_timestamp to current time + offset


MIGRATION:
- set the initial tenant lookup timestamp to null
- set the initial tenant lookup count to zero


TESTS
- kafka consumer
  - tenantless connections can get inserted
    - validate tenantless timestamp is set to NOW()
    - validate tenantless count is incremented
      - don't worry about changing the count in the connection registrar...just stitch it up in the updater
    - validate message is not sent to inventory

  - update tenantless connection

  - update tenant connection with tenantless info

- stale updater
  - should not process tenantless connections (VERIFIED)
  - processes connection and DOES NOT find tenant
     - should clear org_id and account (VERIFIED)
     - should not change stale timestamp (VERIFIED)
     - should set tenant_failure_lookup_count (VERIFIED)
     - should set tenant_lookup_timestamp to NOW() (VERIFIED)

- tenantless updater 
  - should ignore tenantless connections that have a tenant_failure_lookup_count > X (VERIFIED)

  - processes tenantless connection and DOES NOT find tenant
    - should not change stale timestamp (VERIFIED)
    - should increment tenant_failure_lookup_count (VERIFIED)
    - should set tenant_lookup_timestamp to NOW() (VERIFIED)

  - processes tenantless connection and DOES find tenant
    - should record newly found tenant
      - should set org_id and account (VERIFIED)
      - should set tenant_lookup_failure_count to zero (VERIFIED)
      - should set tenant_timestamp to null (VERIFIED)

- connection lookup should not find tenantless connections
